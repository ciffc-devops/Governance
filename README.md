# What is N-FIRE?
The National Fire Management Toolbox (N-FIRE) is a user-friendly resource hub for national agencies grappling with wildfires. It offers tools and strategies to plan, prevent, and control wildfires, including community-based solutions. From advanced technology for understanding fire behavior to tools that help communities prepare and respond, the N-FIRE is designed for simplicity and effectiveness. It's not just about assessing risks and detecting fires early; it's also about involving communities in the process, ensuring everyone plays a part in staying safe and protecting our environment from wildfires. Whether agencies make decisions with real-time information or work on sustainable land use practices, the N-FIRE is the essential toolbox for coordinated wildfire management efforts.
